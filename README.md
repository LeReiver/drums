<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>The goal of this was to build a simple Android App that I can deploy to the Google Play Store</p>
<h4>My Solution</h4>
<p>I decided to make a rudimentary drum machine that utilized buttons to activate the sounds of the selected parts of the drum set as well as highlighting the section of the drum that is being played. The app is optimized for all device sizes and positions. Offers language support for Italian and Japanese upon general language settings of device.</p>
<h4>The Result</h4>
<p>I was able to make a simple Android App and deploy it to the Google Play Store for free downlaod.</p>
